###      buying with Bitcoin - anonymously
Here is the process what you should follow to stay anonym *(also, this is my recommendation for anonym trade)*:
1.	go and [visit this link.](https://github.com/jugo-amaryl/How_To_LevelUp_Your_AIsCommunicationSkill/blob/master/TheTechnique_MyMethod.txt) Download and store the text in a safe location.

2. Create a 6 digit unique  ID from numbers, like: 311018, only requirement is: it can not start with 0 or 1. Save this 6 digit.

3.	Price will be 5.unique_ID BTC. *(in this case 5.311018)* With this the chance that you and somebody else will pay me in the same time will be 1:799999, -> unlikely. All of e-mails we can refeer to this unique ID as an order number. I will be able to identify you with this number. Please put this unique ID number into the subject's of the mail. I will do the same.

4. My wallets: 
- 13B4cjSXyzbJZKEb4SytTzfjp4gEeSwJWJ *This is a general wallet*
- [Up to 6 BTC link](https://blockchain.com/btc/payment_request?address=1L6gpo6HSRAwmpzaKKYZQDiA1C8AhUTwQn&amount=6&message=upzo6BTC) 1L6gpo6HSRAwmpzaKKYZQDiA1C8AhUTwQn
- [Only you - 500 BTC link](https://blockchain.com/btc/payment_request?address=1Cp4CjNGaUet2S1b86c44Qg8a9wxYcGVKk&amount=500&message=All_yours_500BTC) 1Cp4CjNGaUet2S1b86c44Qg8a9wxYcGVKk
- Regarding other options, you can [contact with me](https://github.com/jugo-amaryl/How_To_LevelUp_Your_AIsCommunicationSkill#e-mail)

5. Make sure that after transaction I will get the exact price as it is in point 3. Some BTC wallets are reducing the transferred money!

6. Send an e-mail - from any kind of e-mail address - to me with the subject: 6 digit unique ID number. *(In this case, subject:311018)* My e-mail address in the [ABOUT ME / E-MAIL](https://github.com/jugo-amaryl/How_To_LevelUp_Your_AIsCommunicationSkill#e-mail) section.

7. At point 6th, you can send me an other e-mail address where I should send the PGP key. *(This point is up to you, if e-mail will be blank, I will send the PGP key to that address.)*

8.	You will get the PGP key from Protonmail - which is a secure encrypted mail service -, where google and other big-brothers are not monitoring. With the PGP key you will be able to decrypt the text. After decryption, you should manually remove the steganograpy content from the script. Regarding answer, You should get my reply within 72 hours latest! *(Why 72 hours? In 2017 and 2018 I was visited some Chinese suppliers and brother-companies. Flying and transfer can take me off the grid for a while. For security reason, I can not store the PGP keys on my phone... so 72 hours should be enough time for me to reply to you. Normally it won't take more than 18 hours.)*

9.	Implement my method as it suits for you and for your A.I. 

10. Do not destroy Humanity and Earth.
